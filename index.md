I am currently a student in the MPhil Linguistics program at UCL. My research areas are psycholinguistics and pragmatics. My ongoing research projects at UCL include predictive processing (advised by Prof. [Wing Yee Chow](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucjtwyc/Home.html)) and scalar implicature (advised by Prof. [Richard Breheny](https://sites.google.com/site/expraglab/expraglab-semantics-pragmatics-social-cognition)). Before coming to UCL, I graduated from the University of Chicago with a BA in Linguistics and a BA in Psychology. There I worked with Prof. [Ming Xiang](https://lucian.uchicago.edu/blogs/mingxiang/) on the psycholinguistics of island effect and ellipsis.

Broadly speaking, my research interest is in the effect of discourse context on sentence processing and linguistic meaning. Naturalistically, how we use language is affected by the context we use it in. To borrow from a classic conversation model, the discourse context includes the question under discussion (QUD), the interlocuter's beliefs and knowledge states, and the propositions they bring on the table (some at issue given the QUD, others not). On a higher level, the context also involves the interlocutors' goals, identity, and the general setting. I am interested in 1\) how these discourse factors give rise to rich multilayered linguistic meaning, and 2\) how we process sentences under their influence.

To study my research questions, I have adopted various methodologies including behavioral and eye-tracking experiments. In the future, I plan to expand my experimental methods to include neuroscientific recordings and computational models.
