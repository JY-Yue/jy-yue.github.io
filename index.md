I am currently a student in the MPhil Linguistics program at UCL. My research topics here include predictive processing (advised by Prof. Wing Yee Chow) and scalar implicature (advised by Prof. Richard Breheny). Before coming to UCL, I graduated from the University of Chicago with a BA in Linguistics and a BA in Psychology. There I worked with Dr. Ming Xiang on the psycholinguistics of island and ellipsis. Broadly speaking, my research interest is in the effect of discourse context on sentence processing and interpretation.
