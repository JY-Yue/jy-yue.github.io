When I procrastinate, I enjoy brewing coffee, cooking, playing tennis, and watching soccer. I'm also a fan of civil aviation. When I want to relax, I like playing board games and also just watching TV shows or youtube videos. Since coming to London, I've developed an interest in theater shows. 

I have some amateur academic interests outside of linguistics. As a person who's lived in Shanghai, Chicago, and London (a combined population of 36 million!), I am interested in urban studies, particularly the definition of a city as a certain kind of interpersonal relationship. As a person who's working on a scientific study of language, I am interested in the philosophy and history of science and technologies.
